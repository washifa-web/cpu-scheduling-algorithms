# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C
Operating Systems and CPU Scheduling algorithms. Implemented and analyzed First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (RR) to understand system performance metrics like turnaround time and waiting time.

This project implements **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin

It calculates:
- Waiting Time
- Turnaround Time
- Average Times

## Run the Code
```bash
gcc scheduling.c -o scheduling
./scheduling
